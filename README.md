## Overview

This repo contains a demo eCTD submission package (not the Python package)
as a companion of the book
[Python for Clinical Study Reports and Submission](https://pycsr.org/).

## Structure

The folder structure only focuses on the primary components where Python is involved:

- Module 1: administrative information and prescribing information
- Module 5: clinical study reports

thus is greatly simplified compared to a full submission package.

## Data

The example ADaM dataset is from the PHUSE CDISC Pilot replication ADaMs
following ADaM IG v1.0, publicly available at the
[PHUSE Github Repository](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/data/adam/TDF_ADaM_v1.0.zip).
